# üè¶ Banking Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project is a simulation of a multi-floor banking network infrastructure built using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates VLAN segmentation, DHCP automation, wireless access, inter-VLAN communication, routing with OSPF, server deployment, and security policies.

---

## üìã Project Objectives

- Implement **OSPF** as the routing protocol.
- Support up to **60 users** per department with both **wired and wireless** access.
- All clients must obtain IP addresses via **DHCP**.
- Enable communication between departments using **inter-VLAN routing**.
- Configure an **HTTP server** and an **Email server**.
- All IP addresses are assigned **dynamically from the Layer 3 switch**.
- Enable **SSH access** on all routers.
- Apply **basic configuration** on all devices:
  - Hostname
  - Enable & Console Passwords
  - Message of the Day Banner
  - Disable DNS Lookup
  - Password Encryption
- Each department is isolated in its own **VLAN and subnet**.
- Apply **Port Security**:
  - Sticky MAC addresses
  - Violation mode: shutdown
- **Verify** full end-to-end communication across the network.
